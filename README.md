# Food-Distribution-System
The Food Bank Project is a web application designed to help food banks manage their inventory and connect with people in need. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allows users to browse available food items, check their availability, and request them. The application also includes an admin panel for managing inventory, adding new items, and updating existing ones.
